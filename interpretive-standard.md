# Griffon Fauve de Bretagne Interpretive Standard

This document provides a community‑based interpretation of the United Kennel Club (UKC) breed standard for the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne, with an emphasis on traits essential for its work as a scenthound.

## General Appearance

A medium‑sized, rustic, and well‑balanced hound, built for endurance and agility in rough terrain. The overall impression should be that of a functional hunting dog, never exaggerated or overly refined.

## Head

- **Skull**: Moderately wide, with a slight occipital protuberance. The stop is pronounced but not abrupt.
- **Muzzle**: Strong, of good length, with a straight nasal bridge. The lips are tight and clean.
- **Eyes**: Dark, expressive, and set well apart. The expression is alert and kindly.
- **Ears**: Set at eye level, folded, and carried close to the head. The leather is fine and reaches approximately to the tip of the nose when pulled forward. Proper ear set and carriage are critical for scenting ability.

## Body

- **Neck**: Strong, of moderate length, without dewlap.
- **Forequarters**: Shoulders long and sloping, elbows close to the body. Legs straight and well‑boned.
- **Chest**: Deep, reaching to the elbow, with well‑spring ribs.
- **Back**: Firm and level, with a slight rise over the loin.
- **Loin**: Muscular and slightly arched.
- **Hindquarters**: Powerful, with well‑angulated stifles and low hocks.
- **Feet**: Tight, well‑knuckled, with strong pads. The feet are essential for traversing rough ground.

## Coat

- **Texture**: Harsh, dry, and wiry, providing protection from brambles and weather. The undercoat is dense.
- **Length**: Medium, with eyebrows and a beard that are typical but not excessive.
- **Color**: Wheaten or fawn, in shades from light wheaten to a rich red‑gold. Any white markings should be minimal.

### Color Interpretation

The ideal fawn color ranges from a light wheaten to a rich red‑gold. Washed‑out gray or mahogany shades are undesirable.

## Movement

Free, effortless, and ground‑covering. The gait should be balanced and efficient, reflecting the breed’s stamina and agility.

## Temperament

Gentle, affectionate with family, and determined in the field. The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne should be neither shy nor aggressive.
