# Griffon Fauve de Bretagne Health and Welfare Guidelines

This document outlines recommended health‑screening practices and care guidelines for the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne. The aim is to promote the breed’s long‑term well‑being and avoid exaggerations that could compromise health or working ability.

## 1. Ear Infections

- **Description**: The breed’s folded ears can trap moisture and debris, creating a favorable environment for bacterial or yeast infections.
- **Recommended Practice**: Regular weekly inspection and gentle cleaning with a veterinarian‑approved ear cleaner. After swimming or bathing, ears should be dried thoroughly. Any sign of redness, odor, or excessive scratching warrants veterinary attention.

## 2. Hip Dysplasia

- **Description**: A developmental condition where the hip joint does not fit properly, potentially leading to arthritis and mobility issues.
- **Recommended Practice**: Breeding dogs should be screened with radiographs evaluated by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or an equivalent registry. Moderate exercise, maintaining a lean body condition, and avoiding excessive jumping during growth can help reduce the risk.

## 3. Eye Conditions (e.g., Progressive Retinal Atrophy)

- **Description**: Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a group of genetic diseases that cause gradual vision loss and can lead to blindness.
- **Recommended Practice**: Annual eye examinations by a board‑certified veterinary ophthalmologist, with certification through the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) or similar program. Breeders should avoid using dogs with known PRA‑affected lineages.

- **Mental Stimulation**: Provide regular scent‑work, tracking, or other activities that engage the breed’s natural hunting instincts.
- **Socialization**: Expose puppies and young dogs to a variety of people, environments, and other animals to foster a stable, confident temperament.
